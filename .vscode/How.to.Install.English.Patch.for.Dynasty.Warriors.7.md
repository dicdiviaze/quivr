# How to Install English Patch for Dynasty Warriors 7
 
Dynasty Warriors 7 is a hack and slash video game developed by Omega Force and published by Koei. It is the seventh installment in the Dynasty Warriors series, which is based on the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. The game was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011, and for Microsoft Windows in 2012. However, the PC version only has Chinese and Japanese language options, which can be a problem for some players who want to enjoy the game in English.

Luckily, there is a fan-made English patch that can translate most of the game's text and menus into English. The patch was created by a group of modders who call themselves "Dynasty Warriors English Patch Team". The patch is not official or endorsed by Koei, so use it at your own risk. Here are the steps to install the English patch for Dynasty Warriors 7:
 
1. Download the English patch v2 from this link: [https://steamcommunity.com/app/211140/discussions/0/810921273842794733/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/211140/discussions/0/810921273842794733/). This is a forum thread where you can find more information and updates about the patch. The link to download the patch is in the third comment by Sephiroth983-ThrilledGamersTV[^1^]. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the files from the .rar archive.
2. Extract and copy everything from the .rar file. Then, paste it into the installation folder of Dynasty Warriors 7. The installation folder is usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Koei\Dynasty Warriors 7 or C:\Program Files\Koei\Dynasty Warriors 7, depending on your system.
3. Run Patch.bat and wait until it's finished. This will apply the patch to your game files. You may need to run it as administrator if you encounter any errors.

If you want to learn more about Dynasty Warriors 7, here are some tips and tricks that might help you:

- The game has four main modes: Story Mode, Conquest Mode, Free Mode, and Challenge Mode. Story Mode follows the historical events of the Three Kingdoms era, with each kingdom having its own storyline and characters. Conquest Mode allows you to create your own character and explore the map of China, completing missions and unlocking new features. Free Mode lets you replay any stage from Story Mode or Conquest Mode with any character you want. Challenge Mode tests your skills in various mini-games and leaderboards.
- The game features over 60 playable characters, each with their own unique weapon and fighting style. You can switch between two weapons during battle, which can create different combos and effects. You can also upgrade your weapons by finding or buying seals, which can enhance their attributes and abilities. Some weapons have special effects that can trigger under certain conditions, such as elemental damage, critical hits, or musou attacks.
- The game uses a system called "bond", which measures the relationship between characters. You can increase your bond with other characters by fighting alongside them, talking to them, or giving them gifts. Having a high bond with a character can unlock new events, conversations, and endings in Story Mode and Conquest Mode. You can also form sworn siblings or spouses with certain characters, which can grant you special bonuses and skills.
- The game has a lot of content to explore and unlock, such as costumes, wallpapers, music tracks, weapons, stages, characters, and more. You can access most of these features from the Gallery menu or the Camp menu in Conquest Mode. You can also download additional content from the online store or the Steam Workshop, such as new scenarios, characters, weapons, and mods.
